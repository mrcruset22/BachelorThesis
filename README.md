# From Feature Selection to Data Augmentation: the ADA Algorithm

This code was used for the development of the CSE3000 Reseatch Project in Computer Science and Engineering at Technische Universiteit Delft. 

The ada.py file includes the presented algorithm and desirability computation techniques. This script is used in different evalutation files where the algorithm was tested.
